##' Copy files from a packet to anywhere. Similar to
##' [orderly::orderly_dependency] except that this is not used in an
##' active packet context. You can use this function to pull files
##' from an outpack root to a directory outside of the control of
##' outpack, for example. Note that all arguments need must be
##' provided by name, not position, with the exception of the id or
##' query.
##'
##' You can call this function with an id as a string, in which case
##' we do not search for the packet and proceed regardless of whether
##' or not this id is present.  If called with any other arguments
##' (e.g., a string that does not match the id format, or a named
##' argument `name`, `subquery` or `parameters`) then we interpret the
##' arguments as a query and [orderly::orderly_search] to find the
##' id. It is an error if this query does not return exactly one
##' packet id, so you probably want to use `latest()`.
##'
##' There are different ways that this might fail (or recover from
##' failure):
##'
##' * if `id` is not known in the metadata store (not known because
##'   it's not unpacked but also not known to be present in some other
##'   remote) then this will fail because it's impossible to resolve
##'   the files. Consider refreshing the metadata with
##'   [orderly::orderly_location_fetch_metadata] to refresh this.
##' * if the `id` is not unpacked *and* no local copy of the files
##'   referred to can be found, we error by default (but see the next
##'   option). However, sometimes the file you refer to might also be
##'   present because you have downloaded a packet that depended on
##'   it, or because the content of the file is unchanged because from
##'   some other packet version you have locally.
##' * if the `id` is not unpacked, there is no local copy of the file
##'   and if `allow_remote` is `TRUE` we will try and request the file
##'   from whatever remote would be selected by
##'   [orderly::orderly_location_pull] for this packet.
##'
##' Note that empty directories might be created on failure.
##'
##' @title Copy files from a packet
##'
##' @param files Files to copy from the other packet, as a character vector.
##'   If the character vector is unnamed, the files listed are copied over
##'   without changing their names. If the vector is named however, the names
##'   will be used as the destination name for the files.
##'
##' In either case, if you want to import a directory of files from a
##'   packet, you must refer to the source with a trailing slash
##'   (e.g., `c(here = "there/")`), which will create the local
##'   directory `here/...` with files from the upstream packet
##'   directory `there/`. If you omit the slash then an error will be
##'   thrown suggesting that you add a slash if this is what you
##'   intended.
##'
##' You can use a limited form of string interpolation in the names of
##'   this argument; using `${variable}` will pick up values from
##'   `envir` and substitute them into your string.  This is similar
##'   to the interpolation you might be familiar with from
##'   `glue::glue` or similar, but much simpler with no concatenation
##'   or other fancy features supported.
##'
##' Note that there is an unfortunate, but (to us) avoidable
##'   inconsistency here; interpolation of values from your
##'   environment in the query is done by using `environment:x` and in
##'   the destination filename by doing `${x}`.
##'
##' If you want to copy *all* files from the packet, use `./` (read
##'   this as the directory of the packet).  The trailing slash is
##'   required in order to be consistent with the rules above.
##'
##' @param dest The directory to copy into
##'
##' @param overwrite Overwrite files at the destination; this is
##'   typically what you want, but set to `FALSE` if you would prefer
##'   that an error be thrown if the destination file already exists.
##'
##' @inheritParams orderly_search
##' @inheritParams orderly_search_options
##' @inheritParams orderly_metadata
##'
##' @return Primarily called for its side effect of copying files from
##'   a packet into the directory `dest`.  Also returns a list with
##'   information about the copy, containing elements:
##'
##' * `id`: The resolved id of the packet
##' * `name`: The name of the packet
##' * `files`: a [data.frame] of filenames with columns `here`
##'    (the name of the file in `dest`) and `there` (the name of the
##'    file in the packet)
