##' Prune orphan packets from your metadata store.  This function can
##' be used to remove references to packets that are no longer
##' reachable; this could have happened because you deleted a packet
##' manually from the archive and ran
##' [orderly::orderly_validate_archive] or because you removed a
##' location.
##'
##' If an orphan packet is not used anywhere, then we can easily drop
##' it - it's as if it never existed.  If it is referenced by metadata
##' that you know about from elsewhere but not locally, then that is a
##' problem for the upstream location (and one that should not
##' happen). If you have referenced it in a packet that you have run
##' locally, the the metadata is not deleted.
##'
##' We expose this function mostly for users who want to expunge
##' permanently any reference to previously run packets. We hope that
##' there should never need to really be a reason to run it.
